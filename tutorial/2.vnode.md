# My First Database

Hopefully, you completed
[part one](https://gist.github.com/russelldb/77b4324827084331f8bb) of
the introduction. This is part two.  My aim in this episode is to get
the very start of a basic Key->CRDT store built. But before that, a
quick recap of what we did so far.

## What Did You Do?

Hopefully you followed
[part one](https://gist.github.com/russelldb/77b4324827084331f8bb),
and it worked. I haven't seen a single mail to the list so assume
either no-one did it, or no-one failed. Pretending it is the latter is
the only way I can go on writing this.

So what do you have on your machine? When you ran that command:

    make devrel

and subsequently joined the nodes into a cluster, what happened? What
is a node?

### What Even Is Riak Core?

You made the most basic riak_core application possible. Riak Core is
the distributed systems goop that Riak and other Basho products are
built on. It provides the abstractions, and basic services needed to
run a clustered application.

Riak Core applications are built around something called the
[ring](http://docs.basho.com/riak/latest/theory/concepts/Clusters/). The
`ring` is split into `partitions` and these `partitions` are the unit
of work in a Riak Core app. A `partition` has an ID, or an `index`. We
use a `hash function` to assign work (or storage) to a partition in
the ring. A Virtual Node, or `vnode` is the actual erlang process that
is responsible for an index position on the ring. Each Node in our
application hosts many vnodes. A `Node` is usually a server, virtual
or physical, but as you've seen from `make devrel` many application
nodes can be run on a single host. A `Node` is than an instance of an
[Erlang release](http://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/release_structure.html).

As well as being a conceptual thing, the `ring` is information that is
gossiped between all Riak Core application nodes. It contains
information about what node hosts the process that is repsonsible for
an index or partition of the ring, (amongst other things we may cover
in a subsequent post.)

The ring is a continuous 160-bit integer hash space. It is split into
a number of partitions (currently always a power of two, by default
64) and these are claimed by the nodes in the cluster. The claim
algorithm is part of Riak Core. When you add, or remove nodes, claim
causes a number of partitions to move to their new homes on a
different node. We use a hash function to assign work to a particular
vnode. Which is what you are seeing if you run:

    rel/crdtdb/bin/crdtdb console
    crdtdb@127.0.0.1)1> crdtdb:ping().
    {pong,433883298582611803841718934712646521460354973696}
    (crdtdb@127.0.0.1)2> crdtdb:ping().
    {pong,1050454301831586472458898473514828420377701515264}
    (crdtdb@127.0.0.1)3> crdtdb:ping().
    {pong,433883298582611803841718934712646521460354973696}
    (crdtdb@127.0.0.1)4> crdtdb:ping().
    {pong,1438665674247607560106752257205091097473808596992}
    (crdtdb@127.0.0.1)5> crdtdb:ping().
    {pong,296867520082839655260123481645494988367611297792}

That long integer is the partition of the vnode that answered the
`ping` with a `pong`.

There is a lot to talk about. Hopefully, this is enough background for
now, and we can learn more about the vnodes, claim, gossip etc. as we
go.

## Vnodes For The Workers!

As mentioned above, `vnodes` are the workers. Each vnode is an Erlang
process. Riak Core has a Vnode Manager that starts some process for the
`partitions` hosted by a node. In order for our Riak Core application
to do anything useful, we need to provide it with a vnode.

A `vnode` is also an
[Erlang Behaviour](http://www.erlang.org/doc/design_principles/des_princ.html#id65569). If
you're used to an OO language, an Behaviour is a little like an
interface, or even an abstract class, or both. A behaviour tells us
what function callbacks we need to code in order to fit into the Riak
Core framework and have our vnode be part of a Riak Core application.

If you want lots of details about all the callbacks we need to
implement to make our vnode, you should have a look at
[Ryan Zezeski's Try-Try-Try blog post](https://github.com/rzezeski/try-try-try/tree/master/2011/riak-core-the-vnode). I've
cribbed from it liberally, but plan to go into less detail.

### What To Do?

Our vnode is going to take CRDTs (from where? more later!) and store
them on disk.

#### A Database In My Database

Where on disk? And how? Luckily, Erlang comes with a really simple way
to store Erlang Terms on disk, it is called
[dets](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dets.html) and we'll use that for
now. We'll have a database per vnode rather than a single database for
all vnodes on a node. Since a vnode is a serial actor, an
[erlang process](http://www.erlang.org/doc/reference_manual/processes.html),
we can save ourselves worrying about complex locking at the database
level this way. And since we're going to store CRDTs, for now we can
use [riak_dt](https://github.com/basho/riak_dt).

#### Let's Go

OK. In case you don't like typing I've pushed this code to the
[SyncFree github account](https://github.com/SyncFree).
